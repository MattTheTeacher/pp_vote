Lesson 4 Code Pack – Public Voting App (pp_vote)

Includes Lesson 1–3 functionality plus:
- Lesson 4: Server-side validation using FormHelper

Run:
1) Copy pp_vote into XAMPP htdocs
2) Start Apache
3) Open http://localhost/pp_vote/public/

Lesson 4 tests:

- Submit valid data: confirmation page appears
- Bypass JS: server-side must still block invalid input
